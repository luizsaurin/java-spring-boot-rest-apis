<h1 align="center"><strong>Java Spring Boot - REST API Projects</strong></h1>

This is my repository of projects developed using Java and Spring Boot. These are simple projects developed as learning, with the aim of exercising different subjects and tools related to the development of REST APIs with Java and Spring Boot. These projects are not complete, ready-to-use applications. These are small projects that I developed and use as a reference. Each project is the application of different knowledge, and each can be executed and tested independently.

I recommend opening each project in a separate editor. Opening all projects in the same editor may cause execution problems.
